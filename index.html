Hi, I'm Curtis Bishop, a Master of Financial Economics student at Utah State Universityâ€™s Jon M. Huntsman School of Business. As the founding president of the Cryptocurrency Club, I've cultivated a passion for decentralized finance and advanced data analytics.
<br><br>
I specialize in time series modeling, predictive analytics, and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems. My expertise includes Python programming, advanced forecasting, and economic impact analysis. Whether it's designing an efficient agent-based modeling framework or conducting in-depth feasibility studies, I thrive on transforming data into actionable insights.

In my free time, I enjoy basketball, chess, and exploring innovative financial technologies.
